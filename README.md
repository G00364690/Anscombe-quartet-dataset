# Anscombe Quartet Analysis
This assignment has been completed in accordance with the tasks set out in the coursework of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module as part of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics in Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.

## Instructions

In order to complete this assigment it was necessary to:
1. Download & install Anaconda
2. Download & install Console Emulator x64
3. Create directory and files such as this README, LICENSE and .gitignore using Linux commands
4. Launch a jupyter notebook from the command line
5. Sync files on my local machine to repository on GitHub allow me to push updates to the jupyter notebook over various commits


To review the analysis methods and conclusions from the assigment:
1. Simply launch the Jupyter Notebook entitled "Anscombe-Quartet.ipynb"
2. Review the full analysis in the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run individual elements of the python code by highlighting cells and using command SHIFT+ENTER
4. Consult the "Initial Research" section of this README file for information on my approach to this assignment
5. Consult the "Method" section of this README file for information on my approach to this assignment
6. Consult the "References" section of this README file for finformation on my further reading in relation to this assigment

## Initial Research
From the lecture series and background material in the course throughout the opening 8 weeks it was clear that the assignment was likely to build on various aspects of the coursework introduced during the lecture series.

Much of our learning from the Win a car probability, the Lady tasting tea scenario, and Bayes theorem in relation to drug testing centred around the likelihood that our first instincts when it comes to thorough statistical analysis can be quite far from being accurate. In particular in the cases of the win a car probability - it's somewhat telling that most participants would elect to stay with their choice - and with Bayes theorem - where one would at first instinct rightly assume that a test with 99% accuracy would be robust - only to find out with further analysis that this is not true (at least under the test parameters we set for the simulation).

Initial research of the Anscombe Quartet points quickly to idea of a set of data designed to be a test case to highlight the perils of limiting analysis methods to purely numerical or statistical properties, rather than supplementing them with graphical analysis to contextualise the outcomes.

## Method
Given the initial research, it was clear our analysis method must comprise both the analysis of statistical properties as well as graphical analysis using plots.

The approach therefore became about determining statistical properties for the 4 datasets including:
1. Mean
2. Standard Deviation
3. X and Y Correlation
